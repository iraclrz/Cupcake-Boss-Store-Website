# Cupcake-Boss-Store-Website
I have crafted a website for a store specializing in cupcakes, drinks, and pastries, featuring an inviting homepage display and a comprehensive menu section. Visitors can enhance their browsing experience by selecting background music, and job seekers can find openings in a dedicated section. Built with HTML and CSS, the website offers a polished interface for seamless exploration of treats and job opportunities.
